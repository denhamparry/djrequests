# Claude Code Project Template

A GitHub template repository that provides a standardized, fully-configured foundation for new projects developed with Claude Code. Includes built-in support for Test-Driven Development (TDD), automated code quality checks, and AI-assisted workflows.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Create Your Project

Click the **"Use this template"** button above to create a new repository from this template.

### 2. Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone your new repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-new-project.git
cd your-new-project

# Open Claude Code
claude
```

### 3. Run the Setup Wizard

In Claude Code, run:

```text
/setup-repo
```

The interactive wizard will:

- ‚úÖ Gather your project information (name, tech stack, commands)
- ‚úÖ Customize configuration files for your specific project
- ‚úÖ Configure pre-commit hooks for your language
- ‚úÖ Set up automated GitHub PR reviews
- ‚úÖ Install and verify all configurations

### 4. Start Building

```bash
# Commit the configured files
git add .
git commit -m "chore: configure Claude Code for project"

# Start developing with TDD!
```

## üì¶ What's Included

### Core Configuration

- **`CLAUDE.md`** - Project context for Claude Code with TDD guidelines
- **`docs/setup.md`** - Comprehensive setup checklist and best practices
- **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`** - Code quality hooks (formatting, linting, security)
- **`.github/claude-code-review.yml`** - Automated PR review configuration

### Custom Slash Commands

Located in `.claude/commands/`:

- **`/setup-repo`** - Interactive setup wizard (run this first!)
- **`/review`** - Comprehensive code review (quality, tests, security, performance)
- **`/tdd-check`** - Verify TDD workflow compliance
- **`/precommit`** - Run pre-commit hooks on all files

## üéØ Key Features

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

This template enforces TDD workflow:

1. **Red** - Write a failing test first
2. **Green** - Write minimal code to make it pass
3. **Refactor** - Improve code while keeping tests green

Use `/tdd-check` to verify you're following TDD principles.

### Automated Code Quality

- Pre-commit hooks for consistent formatting and linting
- Secret detection to prevent credential leaks
- Language-specific quality checks (Python, Go, JavaScript/TypeScript)
- Automated PR reviews with Claude Code

### Claude Code Optimized

- Project-specific context in CLAUDE.md
- Custom slash commands for common workflows
- Automated PR reviews configured out of the box
- Best practices built into the template

## üõ†Ô∏è Supported Languages

The template is language-agnostic but includes pre-configured hooks for:

- **Python** - Black, Flake8, isort
- **Go** - gofmt, go vet, go imports
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** - Prettier, ESLint
- **Generic** - File formatting, YAML/JSON validation, secret detection

Simply uncomment the relevant hooks in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` during setup.

## üìö Documentation
